            We're pleased to announce the successful completion of the final
            data migration phase for our valued client, Pon. This significant
            milestone, realised in close collaboration with our partner XAPT,
            draws a journey to its conclusion that began with the initial DM
            planning and scoping exercise on July 9th, 2019. The project,
            encompassing four legal entities, involved a team of skilled
            developers, numerous dedicated hours, and consistent commitment,
            resulting in the successful integration into the state-of-the-art
            NAXT 365 system.

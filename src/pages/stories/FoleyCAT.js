      </h2>

      <p className="project-text">
        We at DDPTech are excited to announce the successful completion and
        Go-Live of the Foley CAT project in the United States, after 15 months
        of diligent effort. This achievement reflects the exceptional
        collaboration between the DDPTech, Foley teams, and our partners at
        XAPT, resulting in one of our most comprehensive and flawless data
        migrations to date.
      </p>

      <p className="project-text">
        The project involved migrating from a legacy CAT DBS ERP system and
        multiple instances of the G3 Builder application to the cutting-edge
        NAXT365 solution using the NAXT 2012 to NAXT365 Upgrade solution. This
        accomplishment marks several firsts for DDPTech and further solidifies
        the strong partnership with XAPT:

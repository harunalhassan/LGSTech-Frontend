          We are pleased to share our experiences from the NADITA 2024 conference, where LGS along
          with DDPTech had a significant presence with a dedicated stand at the expo. This year, three of
          our team members representing LGS &amp; DDPTech attended, further establishing our role in the
          data migration domain. Our ongoing collaboration with XAPT and members of the Caterpillar
          community highlights our commitment to guiding businesses through their data migration
          journey and ensuring a seamless transition to XAPTâ€™s robust NAXT365 solution.
